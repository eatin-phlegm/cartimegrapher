# cartimegrapher
A simple timeline visualizer for writers, that doesn't cost money.

! This is still a work in progress, may contain bugs !

## Setting up...
From inside the project directory
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Executing
Simply run run.py on the command line through Python.<br />

```bash
python run.py
```

## Compatibility
I haven't tested it for anything but Ubuntu (Linux) yet, but since it's Python it should - in theory - work on any machine that has Python installed - Windows, Mac, or Linux.
