# cartimegrapher
A simple timeline visualizer for writers, that doesn't cost money.

! This is still a work in progress, may contain bugs !

# Set Up
To install the prerequisites for the software:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Executing
Simply run app.py on the command line through Python.<br />

```bash
python app.py
```

# Compatibility
I haven't tested it for anything but Ubuntu (Linux) yet, but since it's Python it should - in theory - work on any machine that has Python installed - Windows, Mac, or Linux.
