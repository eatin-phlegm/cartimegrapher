# cartimegrapher
A simple timeline visualizer for writers, that doesn't cost money.

! This is still a work in progress, may contain bugs !

## Setting up...
From inside the project directory, use pip to install the required packages to run Cartimegrapher.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Executing
Simply run run.py on the command line through Python.<br />

```bash
python run.py
```

## Compatibility
I have tested it for Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows 10 and it works well on my personal systems.
In theory it should work on any machine with Python 3 installed though - with the proper packages installed.
